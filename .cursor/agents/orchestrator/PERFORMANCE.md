# Orchestrator & agent system — performance

Improvements to make agents run faster, use fewer tokens, and avoid unnecessary steps.

---

## 1. Routing: only run scripts when needed

 - **Do not run** `find_skill.py` when the domain is obvious from paths:
  - `app/api/**`, `lib/**/service` → backend-developer
  - `app/**/*.tsx`, `components/**` → frontend-developer
  - Both → run both in parallel
 - **Run** `find_skill.py` when the task description is vague (e.g. “improve login experience”) or it’s unclear whether it touches FE/BE/DB.
 - **Benefit**: saves ~50–100ms and a subprocess for clearly-routable tasks.

---

## 2. Agent count: minimum correct set

 - **1 agent**: One file, one module, or one clearly-scoped domain (e.g. fix a README typo, tweak a single component).
 - **2 agents (parallel)**: Bugs/features that touch both UI and API; contract work that needs FE+BE; DB migration + backend. Do not serialize if independent.
 - **Avoid 3+ agents** for small fixes; only use when multiple domains are truly independent (e.g. research + plan + implement from scratch).

---

## 3. Phase 2 (review + QA): risk-based

 - **Default**: After Phase 1 (implement), run **code-reviewer** and **qa-tester** in parallel before considering the task done.
 - **Fast path** (only when the user explicitly says so): if the user explicitly says “skip review/QA”, you may run smoke checks instead of full Phase 2.
 - **Benefit**: reduces 2 model calls for small tasks while keeping full gates for important work.

---

## 4. Handoff: concise, don’t paste full SKILL

 - Each handoff **must start with**:  
   `Act as [specialist] per .cursor/agents/specialists/[specialist]/SKILL.md`
 - **Do not** copy the full SKILL content into the prompt; the path reference is enough.
 - Include: Objective (1–2 sentences), Scope (paths/modules), Constraints, Expected output.
 - **Benefit**: large token savings per handoff, especially for long SKILLs (frontend, backend).

---

## 5. Execution plan: once, fixed format

 - Emit **one** short execution plan before delegating (Goal, Code scope, 1–2 agent blocks, Phase 2, Final merge).
 - Don’t repeat the same content inside each handoff; handoffs only need per-agent scope + task + output.
 - **Benefit**: fewer tokens, less repetition, faster comprehension.

---

## 6. Specialist curated search: only when needed

 - Frontend/backend (and other specialists) can run `scripts/search.py` to retrieve curated guidance.
 - Only run it when the task needs lookup (e.g. “auth ownership”, “design system”). For straightforward tasks (e.g. “change button text”), skip it.
 - **Benefit**: fewer subprocesses and I/O; agents stay focused on implementation.

## 7. Quick summary

| Topic | Do | Avoid |
|------|-----|--------|
| Routing | Use paths/domain when clear; find_skill when ambiguous | Run find_skill for every request |
| Agent count | 1 for single-file/domain; 2 parallel when mapping says so | 3+ agents for small fixes |
| Phase 2 | Mandatory for normal implementation | Skip gates only when user explicitly says `skip review/QA` |
| Handoff | SKILL path + objective + scope + output | Paste full SKILL into prompts |
| Plan | One short execution plan before delegating | Repeating the plan inside every handoff |
| Search | Run specialist search when lookup is needed | Run search for every task |
| Fan-out | Large single-domain work → 2–3 same-specialist instances, merge, then Phase 2 | 3+ different specialists for small fixes |
| shadcn | Shadcn is merged into frontend.md; one frontend handoff covers UI + shadcn | Attach separate long shadcn docs for every task |

---

## 8. Fan-out (same-skill parallel)

 - **When**: A **large** task within **one domain** (many independent components/files) and the specialist has `max_parallel` in `registry.yaml` (e.g. frontend-developer, backend-developer).
 - **Trigger**: Automatically when scope ≥ 4 independent file/component groups, or user says “theme”, “redesign”, “multi-component”, “large scope”.
 - **How**: Split scope into 2–3 disjoint slices, spawn 2–3 instances of the same specialist in parallel, merge outputs, then run Phase 2 **once**.
 - **Cap**: Max **3** instances (avoid overhead). Only fan-out **one** specialist type per task.
 - **Details**: `.cursor/agents/orchestrator/SKILL-DETAILS.md` § Fan-out pattern.
