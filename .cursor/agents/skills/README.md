# Skills — One skill per field

This folder holds **one skill file per field**. Each file is the single source of guidance for that field: job, specialist, context, and when/how to use it. The orchestrator and handoffs reference these files to assign work.

The detailed searchable knowledge now lives in:

- `.cursor/agents/specialists/<specialist-id>/data/catalog.csv` for specialist-local curated guidance
- `.cursor/agents/specialists/<specialist-id>/scripts/search.py` for specialist-local curated lookup
- `.cursor/agents/mappings/rule-map.csv` for canonical rule ownership
- `.cursor/agents/mappings/skill-finder.csv` for task-to-field routing hints
- `.cursor/agents/scripts/find_skill.py` for field/specialist suggestions

## How it works

- **Skill** = job description + specialist + guidance (invoke when, critical rules, boundaries).
- **Specialist** (`.cursor/agents/specialists/<id>/SKILL.md`) = the agent that executes the job; the skill file points to this specialist.

When you assign a task to a field, use the skill file below so the executor knows the job and what to use. Each skill file includes a **Guidance** section with invoke when, critical rules, and boundaries.

## Using a skill in a handoff

Reference the skill file so the agent knows the job and assignment, for example:

- "Do the **frontend** job per `.cursor/agents/skills/frontend.md`. Task: …"
- "Act as backend-developer per `.cursor/agents/specialists/backend-developer/SKILL.md`. Use the job and inputs from `.cursor/agents/skills/backend.md`. Scope: …"

The specialist SKILL is what the agent runs as; the skill file here is the **job spec** (what to do, what to use).

## Search Workflow

- Prefer specialist-local curated search first: `python3 .cursor/agents/specialists/<specialist-id>/scripts/search.py "<query>"`
- If routing is unclear: `python3 .cursor/agents/scripts/find_skill.py "<task description>"`
- Use raw skill/rule search only as fallback with `--fallback-raw`
- Frontend is the intentional exception and keeps its richer multi-CSV UI system
